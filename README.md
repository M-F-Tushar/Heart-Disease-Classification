# 🫀 Heart Disease Classification

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical and demographic features. The goal is to build a predictive model that can support early diagnosis and potentially assist healthcare professionals.

## 📘 About the Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook `Heart-Disease-Classification.ipynb` includes:

- Data preprocessing and exploration  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training with various classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualization of model performance

## 📂 Dataset

The original data came from the [Cleveland database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Howevever, i downloaded it in a formatted way from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset).

The original database contains 76 attributes, but here only 14 attributes will be used. **Attributes** (also called **features**) are the variables what we'll use to predict our **target variable**.t+Disease), **Attributes** containing features such as:

- Age, Sex, Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure, Cholesterol  
- Fasting blood sugar, Max heart rate  
- Exercise-induced angina, ST depression, etc.

> ✅ The dataset is included in the Repository, link is also prvided for it.
